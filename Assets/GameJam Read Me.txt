Hello fellow Gamers! This is a current outline of what is in the project and will go over what some areas are imporant to some people.


Scripts
	-Programmers
		-Managers -> InputManager
			This handles all inputs from the user. The declaration of inputs actions stem from the InputSystem_Actions.inputactions object. 
			If you want to modify or change the user inputs, make sure to regenerate the InputSystem_Actions.inputactions C# if unity doesn't do it automatically.
			This is tied to the player manager object in the scene.

		-Managers -> GameManager -> GameBaseState
			Sets up the base class for all game states.

		-Managers -> GameManager -> GameLoadLevelState
			Handles Loading the game to a level index that is currently set in the load level staate.

		-Managers -> GameManager -> GamePauseState
			Handles pausing and unpausing the game.

		-Managers -> GameManager -> GameRestartState
			Handles restarting the current level.
