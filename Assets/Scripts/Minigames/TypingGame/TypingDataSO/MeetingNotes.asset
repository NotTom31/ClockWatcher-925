  - Secretarial Directive Meeting Notes, XX/XX/XXXX; Transcribed for Archival Documentation
  - To request an official transcript of these notes, retrieve an approval form from
    Office 2B during opening hours (4am to 9am).
  - Forward your form by both electronic and traditional mail to subexecutive management
    and ensure the delay between deliveries does not exceed 3 business days, else
    your request will be discarded.
  - For subexecutive address reference, see section 7G of the employee manual. Recall
    that manuals are published monthly and should be up-to-date.
  - If your transcript request is approved, expect a notification within 90 business
    days.
  - Approval notifications are received in-person outside normal work hours at Offices
    3E or 5J. Report to both offices each day while awaiting approval.
  - This transcript is unofficial and therefore does not provide evidence, real or
    imagined, of words that may or may not have been exchanged during an alleged
    meeting on XX/XX/XXXX.
  - To retrieve an official transcript admissible in a court of law, see the above
    instructions for requesting approval.
  - 'Unofficial transcript begins:'
  - We will not stop. We will never stop. We will not rest. We will never falter.
  - We will pave the unpaved and scrape it away again until nothing remains, less
    than the nothing with which we began.
  - We will cup the future in our hands like water and watch it trickle away. We
    will watch the droplets splatter the earth with lost potential.
  - We are many, we are one, we are known, we are forgotten.
  - We too will forget this, soon enough.
