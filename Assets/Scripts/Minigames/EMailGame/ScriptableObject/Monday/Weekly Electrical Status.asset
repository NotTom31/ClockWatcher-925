  bodyText: "Greetings HR,\r\n\r\nI\u2019m responding to your memo to confirm that
    I have agreed to your electrical management policy and forgo any right to litigation
    in the event of injury or death sustained from low-lighting environments.\r\n\r\nHow
    are the alternator repairs going? I was under the impression that these policies
    were temporarily enforced until the repairs were finished, but I haven\u2019t
    heard an update in months.\r\n\r\nThank you for your communication,\r\nEmployee
    925"
  recievedMessageText: "This is our weekly reminder that due to low grid-level electrical
    supply, the office will continue to enforce power saving measures. Employees
    must choose one of the following electrical usages at a time:\r\n- Your computer\r\n-
    Your printer\r\n- Your lights\r\nSwitching on one will disable the others. Remember
    that lighting is a luxury! \r\n\r\nPlease respond to this email to confirm that
    you have agreed to our electrical management policy and forego any right to litigation
    in the event of injury or death sustained from low-lighting environments.\r\n\r\nHave
    a great week!\r\nHR"
