    supply, the office will continue to enforce power saving measures. Employees
    must choose one of the following electrical usages at a time:\n- Your computer\n-
    Your printer\n- Your lights\nSwitching on one will disable the others. Remember
    that lighting is a luxury! \n\nPlease respond to this email to confirm that you
    have agreed to our electrical management policy and forego any right to litigation
    in the event of injury or death sustained from low-lighting environments.\n\nHave
    a great week!\nHR"
