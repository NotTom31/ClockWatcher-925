  bodyText: "Hello HR Department,\r\n\r\nThank you for your generous offer to continue
    working at the office. However, I have concluded I am still committed to the
    two weeks notice that I sent last Monday.\r\n\r\nThat will make this Friday my
    last day at the office. \r\n\r\nI want to reiterate that the working conditions
    here have grown less and less tolerable, impacting my health and my ability to
    produce work I am proud of. Having the work follow me home is unacceptable to
    me. So please do not offer me another bonus or raise, I cannot in good conscience
    commit to more than this last week.\r\n\r\nThank you again and hope you are well,\r\nEmployee
    925\r\n"
