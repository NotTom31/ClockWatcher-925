  recievedMessageText: "Hello Everyone,\r\n\r\nHope you had a great weekend! This
    is Employee 366 from the wellness department. I know many of you are still touched
    by the troubling events of last Thursday, which is why we wanted to give employees
    a quick workshop on healthy practices in the workplace. Confidence is key to
    delivering excellent performance!\r\n\r\nIf you are struggling with aberrant
    visuals, just remember SALES! \r\n\r\nSee Anything? \r\nLights! \r\nEnergy Saving
    - turn those lights back off so you can get to work!\r\nOur internal reporting
    shows that in 50% of cases, correctly following the SALES protocol will keep
    employees in good enough physical health to come back to work next week!\r\n\r\nHave
    a great week!\r\nEmployee 366"
